      <description>OVERVIEW My father has been writing short tales for children and publishing them in local Assamese publications for as long as I can remember. &amp;ldquo;Bondeep, Bonoshreehotor Golpo&amp;rdquo; (Bondeep, Bonoshree&amp;rsquo;s Tales) is a collection of short stories created and collected to raise awareness about the preservation of our natural environment. I consider myself fortunate to have assisted him with the typesetting andÂ design of this book. The book will be available at local bookstores on December 6, 2022.</description>

      <description>OVERVIEW Author J. B. S. Haldane and his book My Friend Mr Leakey always fascinated me. It has been one of my favorite books. During my Master&amp;rsquo;s we were asked to redesign any of our favorite books. It came as a perfect opportunity to design it in a way I imagined the world of Mr Leakey would look like.
I hope you enjoy this design as much as I loved working on it!
