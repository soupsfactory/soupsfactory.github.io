      <description>Author J. B. S. Haldane and his book My Friend Mr Leakey always fascinated me. It has been one of my favorite books. During my Master&amp;rsquo;s we were asked to redesign any of our favorite books. It came as a perfect opportunity to design it in a way I imagined the world of Mr Leakey would look like.
I hope you enjoy this design as much as I loved working on it!
