      <description>INTRODUCTION Folk musical instruments bind one&amp;rsquo;s community together. Within a community, each instrument has its own specific use, place and time to be played. However, with the popularization of new electronic musical instruments and music, the audience base of traditional folk musical instruments have decreased considerably.
To gather more information about the same, we met with Brahmaputra cultural Foundation(BCF), an NGO who is working on conserving folk musical instruments of the North-eastern states of India.</description>

      <description>Overview BACKGROUNDTraditional folk musical instruments are facing extinction in many parts of India due to decrease in its user base. The purpose of this study was to determine an effective medium to introduce these musical instruments: their construction process, sounds and events they are used at, to a younger audience, in order to create a future user base of individuals with better understanding of the same.
OBJECTIVEThrough this study we aim to introduce different mediums of instruction to children above age of 8 years and observe how they respond to them.</description>

      <description>Overview BACKGROUNDCan we foster curiosity in children about our natural environment? During the Interaction Design module at IDC School of Design, we (our group had 4 participants) were assigned a project - nudge children to explore their natural environment more, with one constraint - through the use of Colours.
PRODUCT DETAILSThrough the use of colours and textures, the Nature’s Palette app aims to help kids connect with their surroundings. Together, kids explore their environment and take photos of the many colours and textures they encounter.</description>

      <description>Overview BACKGROUNDFlower project started as a discussion with my then manager at Eli Lilly India, Anand Sawkar. We were talking about data visualisation when the topic changed to whether it was possible to find out who in our company like superhero movies. Then we began to consider whether we might create a humorous data visualisation to determine whether people at Lilly have similar interests. Would it start discussions? Assemble players to play football during weekends?</description>
