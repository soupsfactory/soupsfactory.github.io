      <description>Hello World!
I am Supriya.
I see design as a way to communicate through a collaborative and experiential medium. I am driven more towards work that involves making and breaking, data, visualization, storytelling, experiments, explorations, game design strategies..(and blue food).
Currently working as a User Experience Specialist at MathWorks Bangalore, India. Here, we are trying to explore ways for users to have a smooth experience with the software and its complex strategies and functionalities.</description>
