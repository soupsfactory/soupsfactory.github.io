      <description>Flower project started as a discussion with my then manager at Eli Lilly India, Anand Sawkar. We were discussing Data visualization and were wondering if there was a way to know if anybody in our office is a superhero movie enthusiast ;) . And then we started wondering if we can have a playful Data viz to know if folks at Lilly, share common intersets. Would it strike up conversations? Find folks to play football over the weekends?</description>

      <description>Predible Health is an AI startup. They work with Artificial Intelligence to draw out information from Radiology data. We collaborated on a project to create physical reports for the users – Pulmonologist, radiologist, and patients. The objective of the project was to find an effective way of representing the Lung CT Scan data into a medical report, specially catered to our target users. The data we wanted to present was divided into three sections: Nodule analysis data, Low Attenuation analysis data, and High Attenuation analysis data.</description>

      <description>Majuli district (27.0016° N, 94.2243° E) is a river island in Assam, surrounded by the river Brahmaputra. The island is a beautiful landscape of nature with land and aquatic flora and fauna, inhibited by different tribal and non tribal communities. The river island was influenced by the then Vaishnavait movement of Assam with the establishment of a satra at Dhuwahat by the saint Shankardeva.
The art of Mask making has been an exquisite culture of Majuli satras.</description>

      <description>Author J. B. S. Haldane and his book My Friend Mr Leakey always fascinated me. It has been one of my favorite books. During my Master&amp;rsquo;s we were asked to redesign any of our favorite books. It came as a perfect opportunity to design it in a way I imagined the world of Mr Leakey would look like.
I hope you enjoy this design as much as I loved working on it!
