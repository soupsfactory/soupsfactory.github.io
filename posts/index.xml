We were talking about data visualisation when the topic changed to whether it was possible to find out who in our company like superhero movies. Then we began to consider whether we might create a humorous data visualisation to determine whether people at Lilly have similar interests. Would it start discussions? Assemble players to play football during weekends?</description>

I hope you enjoy this design as much as I loved working on it!
