      <description>Overview Understanding user&amp;rsquo;s perception of space and latency in VR Duet is a VR dance game for two players, who interact via a glowing string linked to their avatars&amp;rsquo; &amp;ldquo;hands.&amp;rdquo; While VR promises shared dancing experiences remotely, challenges include network latency, the lack of full-body tracking in affordable devices, and limited real-world space in users&amp;rsquo; homes.
This was done as a part of ongoing research by Markus Laattalaat Aalto under the supervision of Prof. Perttu Hämäläinen.</description>
