      <description>Flower project started as a discussion with my then manager at Eli Lilly India, Anand Sawkar. We were discussing Data visualization and were wondering if there was a way to know if anybody in our office is a superhero movie enthusiast ;) . And then we started wondering if we can have a playful Data viz to know if folks at Lilly, share common intersets. Would it strike up conversations? Find folks to play football over the weekends?</description>
