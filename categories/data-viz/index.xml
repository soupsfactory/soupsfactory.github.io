      <description>Overview BACKGROUNDFlower project started as a discussion with my then manager at Eli Lilly India, Anand Sawkar. We were talking about data visualisation when the topic changed to whether it was possible to find out who in our company like superhero movies. Then we began to consider whether we might create a humorous data visualisation to determine whether people at Lilly have similar interests. Would it start discussions? Assemble players to play football during weekends?</description>
